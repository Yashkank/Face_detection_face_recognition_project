# Face_detection_face_recognition_project
This project is a robust, real-time face detection and recognition system designed to automate attendance management using live surveillance footage. Built with InsightFace, OpenCV, and Tkinter, the system integrates an RTSP IP camera feed to detect and recognize human faces efficiently and log attendance securely.The core functionality of the system relies on deep learning-based face analysis, which includes facial detection, alignment, and embedding extraction using InsightFaceâ€™s powerful buffalo_s model. Once a face is detected from the video stream, it is compared against pre-registered known face embeddings using cosine similarity to determine identity. The recognition accuracy is optimized with precise threshold tuning, confidence evaluation, and efficient vector matching techniques.
To ensure performance and system efficiency, the system processes every nth frame (as configured), minimizing CPU overload and unnecessary operations. It also logs detection time, recognition time, and CPU performance metrics using the psutil library to monitor resource utilization in real time. Recognized faces are logged into a timestamped CSV file, while unknown faces are ignored or flagged, depending on confidence level. Additionally, repeat logging is controlled to prevent multiple entries for the same person within a short time window.The system features a simple but functional GUI built with Tkinter, allowing the user to start and stop the camera stream with a click. Recognized faces trigger a short audio alert using the winsound module for immediate feedback.
